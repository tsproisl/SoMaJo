CHANGELOG
=========

Version 1.2.0, 2016-09-01
=========================

parallelization, configurable paragraph separator

Version 1.1.2, 2016-08-25
=========================

The example in the documentation is now self-contained: Sample input
has been added and the output will be printed.

Version 1.1.1, 2016-08-19
=========================

The link in the Evaluation section of the Readme now points to the
complete gold standard data.

Version 1.1.0, 2016-08-19
=========================

SoMaJo can now output additional information about the original
spelling of the tokens, i.e. if a token was followed by whitespace or
if a token contained internal whitespace (according to the
tokenization guidelines, things like “: )” get normalized to “:)”). To
use this feature, provide the tokenizer script with the ``-e`` option.

Version 1.0.3, 2016-08-18
=========================

This version works around a bug in the regex module that caused
exponential runtimes on certain inputs.
